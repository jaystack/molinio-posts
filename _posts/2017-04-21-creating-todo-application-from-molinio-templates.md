### Introduction
In Molinio, we can build our own microservices application. With help of templates we can create projects that use React, Amqp and Rest library in a few moments, in JavaScript and TypeScript languages. In addition we may create RabbitMq and MongoDB servers, if necessary. With Molinio we create a simple TODO application. The finished projects can be found in the GitHub links below: links
